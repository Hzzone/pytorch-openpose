## pytorch-openpose

This fork is a modified version of the original repo specialized for using OpenPose models on MPII-like data. 

### Model Download
Here is the procedure to download a pre-trained MPII OpenPose model:
```
mkdir model
wget -P model/ https://www.dropbox.com/s/fol13clg8jl80bg/pose_iter_146000.caffemodel.pt
```

This is the pre-trained model from [original CVPR 2017 OpenPose repo](https://github.com/ZheC/Realtime_Multi-Person_Pose_Estimation), converted using [caffemodel2pytorch](https://github.com/vadimkantorov/caffemodel2pytorch).  
For reference, the original caffe model can be found [here](http://posefs1.perception.cs.cmu.edu/Users/ZheCao/pose_iter_146000.caffemodel). 

### Annotation Downloads
```
wget http://posefs1.perception.cs.cmu.edu/Users/ZheCao/masks_for_mpii_pose.tgz
```

Please cite these papers in your publications if it helps your research (the face keypoint detector was trained using the procedure described in [Simon et al. 2017] for hands):
